# Project-Database

Python based FitTracker app.
Python based GUI written using PyQt5.

Entire software was converted from saving to a .txt file to a MySQL database.
PyODBC was used to send/receive database requests.

Database is now hosted on AmazonRDS.

As of now, you can only create an account through https://www.fittracker.fit.
There is code written for a sign up window inside the software, however, it is now unused so users can access the webstie.
  
Python software was written as a project to test my abilities. This software will be phased out once all of its functionality becomes a part of the React based https://www.fittracker.fit website.

Executable file can be found in DIST folder.
