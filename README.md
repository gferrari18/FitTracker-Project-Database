# Project-Database

Small Update to FitTracker
Instead of saving data using .txt files, it now utilizes a mysql server
The password has been removed from the code

Only the measurement tracker is functioning with the database at this moment
Workout Tracker will be revamped to accomodate different types of workouts. Database will be implemented once the rebuild is complete.
